/**
 * Checks of the way to a contact, kept per contact while the app runs, and
 * of the way between two repeaters. A check sends five traces out along the
 * route and back, one at a time. When the first two stay silent it stops,
 * finds where the way breaks by halving it, and then looks for a way round
 * in the link book (lib/linkGraph.ts), trying four, one trace each; "Keep
 * looking" tries four more from where it stopped. A way that comes back
 * becomes the route, and the one before can be put back. A route being
 * changed on the map is checked the same way, but only to see where it
 * breaks: a way round is not looked for.
 *
 * Only a tap starts any of it; nothing here repeats on its own.
